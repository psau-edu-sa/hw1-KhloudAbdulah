* About the Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University website: 
It is a link launched by the Ministry of Education for university educational services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It allows the user to access the information he needs and obtain a number of services for the educational staff and students. It allows the student, such as adding and deleting subjects, as well as viewing the university schedule and the amount of the reward that is granted to the student. The professor monitors the attendance and absence of students and reviews college reports.

* About our project:
We began our mission by providing the website of Istanbul Bin Abdulaziz University. Remember us from the site, then enjoy explaining the services you provide. We also mentioned the strategy for using the site by educational staff and students and the extent of downloading content for reading.
